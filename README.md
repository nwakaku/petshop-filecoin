### About Project
This is a project like udemy or coursera ...where tutors can create a playlist of courses and get a hash of there 
project which they can share with there students ....
Students who will then login using a hash pass phrase in other to access the playlist of their tutors.

### How Filecoin and IPFS used
videos are being stored on the Filecoin network. Filecoin deals directly for performant retrieval, and retrieved the data via IPFS (where Web3. Storage will be dual pinning the content).
With Web3.Storage, I got all the benefits of decentralized storage technologies with the frictionless experience I expect in a modern dev workflow. All I need to use Web3.Storage is an API token and your data. Under the hood, Web3.Storage is backed by the provable storage of Filecoin and makes data accessible to your users over the public IPFS network.
